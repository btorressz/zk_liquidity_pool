# ðŸš€ ZK-Liquidity Pool ($ZKLP) â€“ Private Staking & Liquidity Rewards

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This **ZK-Liquidity Pool ($ZKLP)** is a **practice project** to improve my **zero-knowledge (ZK) skills with Solana**. The goal is to build a **privacy-preserving liquidity staking system** that allows **liquidity providers (LPs) to stake anonymously, earn rewards, and participate in governance without revealing sensitive data**.

The program is written in **Rust** using the **Anchor framework** and **SPL Confidential Tokens**, integrating **zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs** to enable **confidential transfers, private liquidity staking, and Sybil-resistant identity proofs**.
