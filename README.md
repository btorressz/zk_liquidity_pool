# 🚀 ZK-Liquidity Pool ($ZKLP) – Private Staking & Liquidity Rewards

## 📌 Project Overview
This **ZK-Liquidity Pool ($ZKLP)** is a **practice project** to improve my **zero-knowledge (ZK) skills with Solana**. The goal is to build a **privacy-preserving liquidity staking system** that allows **liquidity providers (LPs) to stake anonymously, earn rewards, and participate in governance without revealing sensitive data**.

The program is written in **Rust** using the **Anchor framework** and **SPL Confidential Tokens**, integrating **zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs** to enable **confidential transfers, private liquidity staking, and Sybil-resistant identity proofs**.

## 🔹 How It Works:
1. **LPs Stake Liquidity Privately**  
   - Liquidity providers stake **$ZKLP tokens** into hidden AMM pools.
   - Staking transactions remain **confidential** using **SPL Confidential Token instructions** and **zk-proofs**.

2. **Private Staking & Rewards**  
   - LPs earn staking rewards **without revealing their holdings**.
   - Rewards are **distributed confidentially** using **zk-SNARK reward proofs**.

3. **Anonymous Trading & Swaps**  
   - Traders using **ZKLP pools** benefit from **reduced fees & priority execution**.
   - Order matching is **shielded against front-running & MEV attacks**.

4. **Confidential Governance & Voting**  
   - Governance voting is done through **zk-SNARKs**, ensuring **only final results are public**.
   - LPs can **delegate voting power anonymously**.

## 🔥 Key Features:
✅ **Confidential Liquidity Staking** – LP balances remain **encrypted** using **SPL Confidential Tokens**.  
✅ **zk-Proof-Based Confidential Transfers** – Prevents tracking of **liquidity contributions & rewards**.  
✅ **Sybil-Resistant Identity Verification** – Uses **Merkle-based zk-SNARKs** to prevent **multi-account abuse**.  
✅ **zk-Optimized MEV Protection** – Prevents **trade order manipulation & front-running**.  
✅ **zk-Tiered Reward Multipliers** – Rewards LPs based on **staking duration** **without revealing exact amounts**.  
✅ **Confidential Governance & Voting** – Users **vote anonymously** while ensuring fair outcomes.  
✅ **zk-Staking Insurance Pool** – Provides **liquidity protection payouts privately** using zk-proofs.  
✅ **zk-Layered Privacy Tiers** – LPs choose **privacy levels** (full anonymity, partial visibility, or full transparency).
