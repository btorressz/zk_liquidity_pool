# ðŸš€ ZK-Liquidity Pool ($ZKLP) â€“ Private Staking & Liquidity Rewards

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This **ZK-Liquidity Pool ($ZKLP)** is a **practice project** to improve my **zero-knowledge (ZK) skills with Solana**. The goal is to build a **privacy-preserving liquidity staking system** that allows **liquidity providers (LPs) to stake anonymously, earn rewards, and participate in governance without revealing sensitive data**.

The program is written in **Rust** using the **Anchor framework** and **SPL Confidential Tokens**, integrating **zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs** to enable **confidential transfers, private liquidity staking, and Sybil-resistant identity proofs**.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
1. **LPs Stake Liquidity Privately**  
   - Liquidity providers stake **$ZKLP tokens** into hidden AMM pools.
   - Staking transactions remain **confidential** using **SPL Confidential Token instructions** and **zk-proofs**.

2. **Private Staking & Rewards**  
   - LPs earn staking rewards **without revealing their holdings**.
   - Rewards are **distributed confidentially** using **zk-SNARK reward proofs**.

3. **Anonymous Trading & Swaps**  
   - Traders using **ZKLP pools** benefit from **reduced fees & priority execution**.
   - Order matching is **shielded against front-running & MEV attacks**.

4. **Confidential Governance & Voting**  
   - Governance voting is done through **zk-SNARKs**, ensuring **only final results are public**.
   - LPs can **delegate voting power anonymously**.
